The "#" symbol is just a placeholder/marker for un-translated entries and should be removed once the translated entry is added.
For some entries, I used `Google translate` to put in French translations. I put an "@" at the end of those lines, because
I don't know French and cannot tell how good the translation is -- maybe someone who knows the language can double-check them.

If you make any improvements to this file, or add a new language, please let me know! With your permission, I'd happily 
include it in future releases for other people to use.

*************************** 
Notes for people adding or altering resources, units, etc from the game:
	Let's say you alter config/units.txt to rename the "ICBM" to
	"Bomb". Then you also need to replace the "ICBM" text in this file with "Bomb".
	The game requires that the first text string in every entry has a direct match in both
	config/units.txt, for example, and this file.
	Also, if you add a new unit, building, etc you also need to add the entry to this file.
	The ordering of the entries doesn't matter (ex. putting "Logs" before "Corn"). 
	It only matters that you put items in the correct block. ex. don't put units in the resource
	block.

Buildings
	Note: Some buildings display text as part of their presentation on the map (the `print_str` entries in config/buildings.txt)
		Presently, the game shows what is provided in that file regardless of the translation here (and the in-game language settings).
		However, the `print_str` settings *can* be changed/translated, or the text removed, if desired.
		The game only reads from config/buildings.txt when a new game is created -- the settings are re-saved in the game's save file,
		so any changes in config/buildings.txt will only take effect for new games.
	The settings below are primarily used in the bottom text display (below the map on the screen)
