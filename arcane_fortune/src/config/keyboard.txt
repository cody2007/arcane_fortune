Note: 
	The game does *not* check for collisions and may execute only one action
	if more than one action is assigned to the same key.

----------------------------
	Cursor movement
---------------------------
`up` and `down` settings can be used in some selection windows (ex. to select
a building for a worker to create). With those windows, if the `up` or `down`
settings clash with one of the selection's keyboard shortcut, then the selection's
keyboard shortcut will be used and the `up` and `down` settings will be ignored in that window.

Text mode cursor control
	(These are only used when the game is launched in screen_reader_mode.
	 Once pressed, the game enters text tabbing mode where it will tab the text
	 cursor through many of the relevant lines of text on the screen.
	 The window screen mode is only used when an in-game window is shown.
	 The bottom screen mode will tab through information describing what you've
	 selected on the map.
	 The right screen mode will contain game alerts (such as if you are attacked),
	 and other statistics like your budget.)

Mouse settings
	Note: if you want to play in text mode (with the ncurses or pdcurses
		version of the game), be aware that the middle mouse click
		does not seem reliably detected. Assigning it to the left_mouse_click
		might be preferred.
