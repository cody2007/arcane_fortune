Arcane Fortune is a game of empire building, diplomacy, conquest, construction, and
deconstruction. Whether or not you build some form of paradise, or a hell on earth is entirely up to you.

Visit https://arcanefortune.com/ for updates, bug fixes, and new versions--it's free for anyone.

The version included here is, in many ways, the beginning. There will be much more in the coming
years: From social unrest and uprisings, stock market collapses, famines, dictatorships, democracies,
environmental transformation, and many topics in between. You can see a peak of our, at present,
primitive silicon-neural-network adversery talk to you in the embassies. Expect to see our silicon-enemy
creep out from the embassy and into your cities in future versions -- maybe with guns and tanks,
maybe more subtly and perversly in ways you might not first recognize :)

Although I release this game in full for free, simply living in this world (and 
producing this game) is not. You can contribute to the development of Arcane Fortune by making
a donation of any amount--donations allow me to allocate more time developing the game. 

Check out the website above to see how you can donate. Thank you!

Some of the features added in v0.2.0 are based on feedback from early testers of v0.1.0. Thank you!

Special thanks to Tchey (http://jeux1d100.net/) for feedback and feature ideas after testing v0.1.0;
some of which were added to v0.1.1 and v0.2.0.

Thanks to GingkathFox on reddit for mentioning some colors in the game are confusing to color blind people.
As of v0.2.0, you can change the color settings in config/colors.txt

Thanks to NeoTheFox on the AF forums for mentioning issues about Linux terminal support.
As of v0.2.0, the game now supports more terminals. See the help file for a list.
