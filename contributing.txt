I gladly accept code contributions, however I ask that you provide
them under the license terms below.

This is mainly because the GPL is incompatible with Steam. I would
like the option to sell a, likely graphical, version of the game
on Steam and possibly other platforms in the future.

Note, you can replace "The Arcane Fortune Developers", in the
license below, with your name, if you wish.
