I gladly accept code contributions, however I ask that you provide
them while either (1) assigning copyright to me or (2) licensing
your contributions to me with the license terms below.

=======================================================
I ask this mainly because the GPL is incompatible with Steam. I would
like the option to sell a, likely graphical, version of the game
on Steam and possibly other platforms in the future.

Note, you can replace "The Arcane Fortune Developers", in the
license below, with your name, if you wish.

Also a point of clarification: as of this revision, the game code
(aside from the libraries it uses) does not contain any other
contributors aside from myself. This is why you do not see
the MIT-like license below in the license.txt file. I have *not* released
my own code under the MIT-like license below. I will, however,
append the license below to license.txt if, or when, others contribute
under those terms.

A reason to choose option (1) and not (2):
If everyone were to license their contributions in the MIT-like license
below, there is a certain risk that eventually my contributions, as the
only code in the project released under the AGPL would become relatively
small. While I'm no lawyer, I believe this could create a situation where
if someone were able to remove all of my code from the project and replace
it, they could release the entire game under a closed-source license.
Assigning copyright to me could prevent this "diluting" of the copy-leftness
of the project. In accepting it to the repository I'll relicense it
to the AGPL, but also, being the copyright holder, still have the option to
put it on distribution platforms like Steam at some point.
